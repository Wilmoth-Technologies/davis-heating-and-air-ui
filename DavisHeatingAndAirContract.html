<h2>3. The project</h2>

<h3>Communications</h3>

<p><mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> responds to all communications relating to an active project within <mark>5</mark> working days, and <mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark> agrees to do the same. If we don&#8217;t hear from you within <mark>10</mark> working days, we reserve the right to invoice you until the end of the current milestone. We&#8217;ll then reschedule your project for the earliest available date.</p>

<h3>Content input</h3>

<p>Beyond the development and deployment of <mark>1</mark> page and <mark>1</mark> website, this contract doesn&#8217;t include content input unless agreed upon separately. If <mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark> wants <mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> to populate a product or website, we&#8217;ll provide a separate estimate.</p>

<h3>Copywriting</h3>

<p>Copywriting isn&#8217;t included in this contract unless agreed upon separately. <mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark> is to provide, proof, and/or sign off on all writing published on the website.</p>

<h3>Illustrations, graphics, and photographs</h3>

<p><mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark> agrees to allow <mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> access to photograph content for the website and be published on the site contingent on prior approval from <mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark>.</p>

<p>Graphics, Illustrations, and Photographs that <mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> creates on this project are the property of <mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark> and will be supplied as requested by <mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark>.</p>

<h3>Revisions</h3>

<p><mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> will devise a project plan that outlines the content, functionality, and structure of the new product or website and will ask <mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark> to agree to it before starting work.</p>

<p><mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> won&#8217;t limit your ability to change your mind. Our price is based on the number of weeks OR billable hours we estimate are needed to deliver the project plan. If you change your mind, want to add something new, or the project needs more time, adding extra weeks won&#8217;t be a problem, and we&#8217;re happy to be flexible. <mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> will provide <mark>Davis Heating & Air</mark> with a separate estimate for additional work.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll have plenty of opportunities to review our work and provide feedback via either:</p>

<ul>
<li>Access to development website</li>
<li>Figma prototypes</li>

<li>Zoom</li>
</ul>

<h3>Progressive enhancement</h3>

<p><mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> follows Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Mozilla&#8217;s Baseline browser categorisation. We use newly available features supported by the latest versions of all core browsers as progressive enhancement, a principle in which design features are automatically turned on based on a browser&#8217;s capabilities. The result is a solid baseline experience where content and core functionality should be accessible to everyone. This also means it&#8217;s OK for products and websites to look visually different across browsers and platforms.</p>

<p><mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> will test current versions of major desktop browsers made by Apple (Safari/Webkit), Google (Chromium), Microsoft (Edge/Chromium), and Mozilla (Firefox). We&#8217;ll also test devices using the current versions of Apple&#8217;s iOS and iPadOS, plus Google Chrome on stock Android.</p>

<h3>Hosting</h3>

<p><mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> will assist with website hosting, email, or other technical services.</p>

<p>You may already have professional hosting and might even manage that in-house; if you do, great. If you don&#8217;t, we&#8217;ll recommend a hosting provider and ask you to set up an account.</p>

<p>Our baseline price includes setting up your website on a server and adding analytics software. You’ll be responsible for hosting, server, domain, email workspace, and other technical service fees. This will be outlined in the cost summary later in the document and additional services/costs may be agreed upon outside of this document.</p>

<h3>Support</h3>

<p><mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> doesn&#8217;t offer monthly support packages. In the first <mark>30</mark> days after completing the project, we will fix bugs in our code within <mark>5</mark> working days of them being reported. After that, fixes, upgrades, or other changes will be charged at our hourly rate of <mark>$100.00</mark> per hour.</p>

<h3>Search engine optimisation (SEO)</h3>

<p><mark>Wilmoth Technology Services LLC</mark> doesn&#8217;t guarantee improvements to search engine ranking, but the products and websites we develop are accessible to search engines, and we follow SEO guidelines.</p>
